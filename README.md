The idea of the project:

1. The code:
     * generates a number
     * allows the user to enter one
     * compares the two numbers
     * outputs a message depending on whether the user's number is greater than, less than, or equal to the one generated by the program
     
2. In a new branch I create:
     * a code that does the same but renders it in a window
     * add text boxes
     * button to get the result
     * task: how to remove the gray line
     
3. Maybe:
     * combine the two branches as I don't need the old one and want the master to be the "latest user version" aka. the one with the window
     * ask - ignoring
